# iOS Setup and AppAuth Sample

Previously we completed our <Link href='/posts/android-https-debugging'>Android HTTP Debugging Setup</Link>. Next we will get a basic iOS OAuth setup working, via the AppAuth iOS code sample.

### Step 1: Sign up with Apple

I signed up for a *Personal Apple Account* so that I could get development tools and run mobile apps on real iOS devices:

![apple account](../images/480/apple-account.jpg)

### Step 2: Install Xcode

I next downloaded and installed the latest [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) development tool, with support for the most recent iOS operating systems and the latest version of the Swift programming language.

### Step 3: Get the AppAuth iOS Sample

Download the code sample via the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS
```

From Xcode’s home screen, select *File / Open* and navigate to the *AppAuth-iOS/Examples/Example-iOS_Swift-Carthage* folder:

![xcode build](../images/480/xcode-build.jpg)

### Step 4: Add the AppAuth Dependency

By default the code sample uses the Carthage dependency tool, which I prefer to avoid. Therefore, I start with some cleanup, by removing the following items:

- The *Example_Extension* folder
- The *AppAuth* entries under *Frameworks*
- The *Carthage* section under *Build Phases*
- The project should then look like this:

![xcode project](../images/480/xcode-project.jpg)

I then add AppAuth using the Swift dependency manager, from the above screen, by providing the URL of the AppAuth iOS repo. When prompted, I add the *AppAuth* and *AppAuthCore* packages to the code sample's target:

![xcode dependencies](../images/480/xcode-dependencies.jpg?v=20240804)

### Step 5: Understand Mobile OAuth Client Settings

In this post we will point the AppAuth code sample to a client that I registered in this blog’s AWS Cognito authorization server:

![oauth client 1](../images/480/oauth-client1.jpg)

![oauth client 2](../images/480/oauth-client2.jpg)

The AppAuth settings are summarised below:

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Client ID**</span> | 53osemtot8tp3n3qct5r2hijk3 |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Redirect URI**</span> | net.openid.appauthdemo:/oauth2redirect |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Scope**</span> | openid email profile |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Issuer URI**</span> | *https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9* |

### Step 6: Update OAuth Client Settings

Before running the app, make the edits documented in the [Example README](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/tree/master/Examples/Example-iOS_Swift-Carthage), to change the below settings in the *AppAuthExampleViewController.swift* module:

```swift
let kIssuer: String = "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9";
let kClientID: String? = "53osemtot8tp3n3qct5r2hijk3";
let kRedirectURI: String = "net.openid.appauthdemo:/oauth2redirect";
```

You must also register the *Redirect URI Scheme* in the mobile app’s *info.plist* file:

![info plist](../images/480/info-plist.jpg)

Note also the contents of the OAuth scopes array. For some providers you will need to add the *offline_access* scope in order to get a refresh token, though Cognito does not require this.

```swift
let request = OIDAuthorizationRequest(configuration: configuration,
                                      clientId: clientID,
                                      clientSecret: clientSecret,
                                      scopes: [OIDScopeOpenID, OIDScopeProfile],
                                      redirectURL: redirectURI,
                                      responseType: OIDResponseTypeCode,
                                      additionalParameters: nil)
```

### Step 7: Run the Sample App on an Emulator

We can run the app using Xcode’s build and run option in the top left of the IDE. I always first select the latest emulator version:

![xcode run](../images/480/xcode-run.jpg)

This renders the following view. You can click *Auto* to run an entire OpenID Connect authorization redirect. Alternatively, do it in two stages, by using *Manual*, where step 1(A) is the front channel redirect, and step 1(B) is the back channel operation to swap the authorization code for tokens:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/480/unauthenticated-app.jpg' alt='unauthenticated app' />
</div>

Next an [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession) window is shown, which first involves informing the user which app they are logging into:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/480/app-login.jpg' alt='app login' />
</div>

You can then sign in to the app using this blog’s cloud test credential:

- User: *guestuser@example.com*
- Password: *GuestPassword1*

The login is done using the system browser, which overlays the mobile view and prevents the sample app from having direct access to the password:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/480/aswebauthenticationsession.jpg?v=20240804' alt='aswebauthenticationsession' />
</div>

After login, control returns to the mobile app, which has an ID token, an access token and a refresh token. You can then test OAuth lifecycle operations, including refreshing the access token:

<div className='smallimage'>
    <img src='../images/480/authenticated-app.jpg' alt='authenticated app' />
</div>

### Where Are We?

We have gained an initial understanding of how to run an OAuth-secured mobile app from Xcode. Shortly we will describe this blog’s <Link href='/posts/ios-code-sample-overview'>iOS Code Sample</Link>, which demonstrates much more complete behaviour.
