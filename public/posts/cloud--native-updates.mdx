# Cloud Native Updates

Previously we described this blog’s <a href='serverless-api-coding-model.mdx'>Serverless API Code Details</a>. This completes a cloud version 1 architecture, where the SPA is deployed to a *Content Delivery Network*, and the API side of the architecture runs without needing to manage any infrastructure.

### Cloud Native

Cloud native platforms such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) provide an alternative for the API side of the architecture, with richer options for both deployed systems and the types of solutions that can be run on a development computer. I think of this as a cloud version 2 architecture.

### Future Updates

In future I will run this blog’s code samples using cloud native supporting components, which will further improve the developer experience. This will not affect the OAuth designs I have used, so no code in either APIs or user facing apps will change.
