# Current State

- Compiles OK
- Runs OK without `Link` elements
- I don't really understand the run function, which does not pick up useMDXComponents

If I can fix that then I can build and run all pages and understand prefetch differences.\
I have the same problem in `next dev` and `next build`.\
Current CSP is disabled - see if benefits are worth reducing security for.
