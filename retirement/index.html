        <h1>OAuth Developer Blog</h1>

        <div>
            <h3>Original Content</h3>
            <p>
                Originally this domain hosted a blog with posts related to APIs and clients that use OAuth security. In addition to explaining integrations, I also discussed some design considerations. There was a particular focus on developer setups and reliability.

            <h3>Improved Content</h3>
            <p>
                I no longer host this blog's content online, since I consider content to be superseded by the O'Reilly book that I have cowritten with colleagues of mine at Curity. The book explains a much more complete OAuth architectural journey, and has been reviewed by multiple parties:

            <h3>Accessing Original Content</h3>
            <p>If you have followed a link to one of the blog's posts, you can still access content if you run the blog locally. The blog used NEXT.js and you run it locally, at <i>http://localhost:3000</i>, using the following commands. Once the blog loads you can navigate to your link's relative location.</p>
