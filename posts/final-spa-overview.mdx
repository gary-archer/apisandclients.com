# Final SPA – Overview

Previously I explained the <Link href='/posts/spa-back-end-for-front-end'>Backend for Frontend</Link> setup  for the final SPA, where remote API components issue cookies for the SPA. Next I summarise the main frontend behaviours of the completed SPA, after which I show how to run it locally.

### Key Features

The final SPA improves on the previous <Link href='/posts/improved-spa-code-sample-overview'>Updated SPA</Link>, to meet some key requirements. It is difficult to satisfy all of these at the same time:

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Best Browser Security**</span> | The SPA calls APIs using the strongest *HttpOnly SameSite=strict* cookies, with no tokens in the browser. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Globally Equal Performance**</span> | The SPA's static web content is delivered to many locations via a *Content Delivery Network (CDN)*. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Pure SPA Development**</span> | Web developers work productively on frontends, with small code bases and no security plumbing. |

### Cloud Hosting

I deploy the overall system of the SPA and APIs to AWS. I upload the SPA’s web static content to S3, then CloudFront replicates the web resources to many global locations, without the need to manage servers or containers:

I deploy the API code sample to AWS as <Link href='/posts/serverless-api-overview'>Serverless Lambda Functions</Link> that the AWS API Gateway exposes to the internet. This provides low cost backend hosting for my code samples.

### Online Deployment

Any reader can use the AWS deployed version of the above architecture from this blog’s <Link href='/posts/quick-start'>Cloud Samples Quick Start</Link> page. You can sign in to the SPA as a test user account, then test OAuth lifecycle events via the demo app’s buttons:

### Code Sample

The SPA code sample manages only frontend concerns. The resources in the *deployment* folder represent web static content hosting variations. The next post shows how to run the code sample locally.

</div>

### Development URLs

You use the following URLs during local development and only the first of these runs on the local computer:

| Component | Base URL |
| --------- | -------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**SPA**</span> | *https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Investments API**</span> | *https://api.authsamples.com/investments* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Investments API Web Route**</span> | *https://bff.authsamples-dev.com/investments* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**OAuth Agent**</span> | *https://bff.authsamples.com-dev/oauth-agent* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Authorization Server**</span> | *https://login.authsamples.com* |

### OAuth Client

In AWS Cognito the deployed SPA registration points to an AWS CloudFront web origin. The SPA is upgraded to a confidential client, and its backend for frontend uses a client credential in grant requests for tokens:

![oauth client production](/images/220/oauth-client-production.jpg?v=20240713)

A second entry exists to run the SPA during development, which has an equivalent registration except that the configured web URLs use a local development web origin.

### React Code

The SPA’s code has been updated to use React as a web framework, to enable better features during coding of views. The SPA renders a tree of views which leads to concurrent API requests. The SPA synchronises both token renewal and login operations when tokens expire.

```jsx
return (
    <>
        <TitleView {...getTitleProps()} />
        <HeaderButtonsView {...getHeaderButtonProps()} />
        {model.error && <ErrorSummaryView {...getErrorProps()} />}
        {model.isLoaded &&
            <>
                <SessionView {...getSessionProps()} />
                <Routes>
                    <Route path='/companies/:id' element={<TransactionsContainer {...getTransactionsProps()} />} />
                    <Route path='/loggedout'     element={<LoginRequiredView {...getLoginRequiredProps()} />} />
                    <Route path='/*'             element={<CompaniesContainer {...getCompaniesProps()} />} />
                </Routes>
            </>
        }
    </>
);
```

### Path Based Routing

Earlier SPAs in this blog used hash based routing. The final SPA instead uses React’s support for path-based routes. The SPA continues to use a *base* path expressed in the index.html file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
    <head>
        <meta charset='utf-8'>
        <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no'>

        <base href='/spa/' />
        <title>OAuth Demo App</title>

        <link rel='stylesheet' href='bootstrap.min.css'>
        <link rel='stylesheet' href='app.css'>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id='root' class='container'></div>

        <script type='module' src='vendor.bundle.js'></script>
        <script type='module' src='react.bundle.js'></script>
        <script type='module' src='app.bundle.js'></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

When the app loads, the React application reads the base path from the *index.html* file and supplies it to the React router. The app then uses relative routes within the */spa/* base path.

### Mobile First

Since the SPA is now cloud-deployed, you can access it on small mobile devices, so I made the final SPA more presentable on smaller screens:

<div className="smallimage">
![mobile view](/images/220/mobile-view.jpg?v=20240713)
</div>

### Web Performance Behaviors

It is common to add undue complexity to web applications in efforts to achieve fast page loads. In some cases, foundations such as deployment are suboptimal. Remote users, who may be located thousands of miles from the web host, then get poor performance.

I prefer to have an awareness of web performance factors but only follow mainstream practices and avoid most optimizations. A strong separation of concerns and clean code should then perform well enough. You should also keep views and API operations simple, especially for your first page. The final SPA uses the following performance-related behaviors.

| Aspect | Responsibilities |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Content Delivery**</span> | Web latency is roughly equal for all global users, since a CDN ensures that all web downloads are fairly local. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Static Content Caching**</span> | The SPA uses cache control headers for web assets, to serve future requests from the browser cache. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**API Response Caching**</span> | The SPA caches HTTP GET responses to prevent redundant API requests, such as during back navigation. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Download Sizes**</span> | As the SPA's code grows I could use micro-frontends to modularize downloads of JavaScript and CSS. |

Requests from the SPA to APIs use CORS, which is standard in any pure SPA architecture, but adds a small performance overhead. The browser sends preflight OPTIONS requests when a user first accesses an API endpoint, after which the browser caches the CORS response for 24 hours.

The real time to first render in a secured web application is not immediate and requires the following steps. The browser makes multiple static content and HTTP requests. Modern networks and the latest HTTP/2 functionality help to manage the steps efficiently:

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Unauthenticated Access**</span> | The time to download HTML resources and run code to detect the user's authentication status. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**OAuth Login**</span> | The time to redirect to the authorization server and present login screens, then return to the SPA. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Secure SPA Access**</span> | The application reload, followed by API requests to get secured data specific to the user. |

### Where Are We?

I summarised the behaviour of the final SPA's web architecture. Development uses a modern web framework and there is an early focus on deployment and performance. You can scale both URLs and code as the web code base grows.
