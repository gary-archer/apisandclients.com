# iOS HTTPS Debugging Setup

Previously we put in place an initial iOS Setup and ran the <Link href='/posts/ios-setup'>AppAuth iOS Code Sample</Link>. Next we will focus on viewing HTTPS mobile traffic from simulators and devices on a development computer.

### Run the HTTP Proxy on the Host

First configure and run the HTTP proxy on the host computer, as described in our earlier write up on <Link href='/posts/http-debugging-setup'>HTTPS Debugging</Link>:

![host proxy](/images/490/host-proxy.jpg)

We also need to instruct the proxy to decrypt SSL traffic, as covered in our post on <Link href='/posts/developer-ssl-setup'>SSL Trust Configuration</Link>:

### Determine the Computer’s IP Address

I use the Charles menu item *Help / Local IP Address* to find my local computer’s IP address, since I usually run on a WiFi network where the IP address is auto assigned:

![local ip](/images/490/local-ip.jpg)

### Configure iOS Simulator Proxy Settings

With iOS Simulators there are quite a few places where we cannot emulate a real device. One of these is network settings, where the simulator instead always uses the local computer’s network:

![ios simulator](/images/490/ios-simulator.jpg)

An HTTP proxy running on the local computer automatically comes into effect for the app on the simulator, which as long as the proxy is started before the simulator.

### Configure iOS WiFi Proxy Settings

For a real iOS device we need to first click the specific network under *Settings / Wi-Fi*. Next select the *Configure Proxy* option, then select *Manual* and enter details similar to the below screenshot:

![ios network](/images/490/ios-network.jpg)

### iOS Device Cellular Proxy Settings

If you ever need to proxy over a cellular network you need to first select *Settings / Mobile Data / Mobile Data Options / Mobile Network*. Then add an *Access Point Name* along with its proxy host and port details:

![ios cellular](/images/490/ios-cellular.jpg)

### Understand Initial SSL Errors

If we now run the system browser or the AppAuth Sample on the iOS device, there will be an attempt to proxy the traffic over HTTPS, and this will result in SSL Trust errors:

![ssl trust error](/images/490/ssl-trust-error.jpg)

This is because the HTTP proxy is intercepting SSL requests at runtime and replacing the root certificate authority. To fix this we need to configure simulators and devices to trust the HTTP Proxy’s root certificate.

### Deploy the HTTP Proxy Root Certificate

If you are using the MITM proxy tool, you can just browse from a mobile browser on the device or simulator to *http`:`//mitm.it*. Then download the certificate to the device’s Downloads folder. Otherwise, there will be an export option similar to that shown below, so use it to save the HTTP proxy root certificate to the local computer.

![proxy root ca](/images/490/proxy-root-ca.jpg)

Rename the file so that it has a *.crt* extension. You can then email the certificate to the device. Alternatively you can run an HTTP server to download the file using a mobile browser. The following steps do this using this blog’s initial code sample:

- git clone https`:`//github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample1
- cd oauth.websample1/api
- cp ~/Desktop/charlesroot.pem ../spa
- npm install
- npm start
- Run the Safari browser on the simulator
- Get the local computer’s IP address, such as 192.168.42.37
- Browse to a URL such as http`:`//192.168.42.37/spa/charlesroot.pem

However you deliver the certificate, save it to the *Downloads* folder. In the following example I used the *Save to files* option:

![save to ios files](/images/490/save-to-ios-files.jpg)

### Configure iOS SSL Trust

Next open the *Files app* and navigate to the certificate. When you tap the file you will then see a prompt that a profile has downloaded:

![profile download](/images/490/profile-download.jpg)

Under *Settings / General / Device Management* there will now be a *Profile* option, and when opened we will see our root certificate:

![installing cert](/images/490/installing-cert.jpg)

Select the Install option and follow prompts:

![installed cert](/images/490/installed-cert.jpg)

Finally switch to *Settings / General / About / Certificate Trust Settings* and activate the certificate:

![activated cert](/images/490/activated-cert.jpg)

### Understand Domain Name Service Lookup

During mobile development it can be useful to also run a local API, with a real world API URL such as https`:`//api.mycompany.com/api. To support this I add a local DNS entry on my local computer:

![local dns](/images/490/local-dns.jpg)

On iOS the DNS settings from the host computer are automatically used by simulators so DNS resolution succeeds, whether or not the proxy tool is running.

### OAuth and API HTTPS Traffic is Now Viewable

On all simulators and devices we can now view OAuth and API HTTPS messages, which can be a big help when we need to troubleshoot.

### Where Are We?

We have now completed our iOS HTTP debugging setup, and will now move on to describe this blog’s fully functional OAuth mobile samples.
