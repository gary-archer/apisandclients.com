# Microsoft Entra ID SPA and API Setup

The previous post provided an <Link href='/posts/updated-api-coding-key-points'>API Code Overview</Link> for the second code sample. Next I port the code sample to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id) and use the same libraries in the SPA and API.

### Main Objective

The goal of the Entra ID code sample is to match the <Link href='/posts/improved-spa-code-sample-overview'>Second SPA and API Code Sample</Link>, ideally with exactly the same code. Only the configuration should need changing:

| Area | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Authorization Server Integration**</span> | The SPA and API integrate with Entra ID and this post explains the authorization server settings. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Same Security Libraries**</span> | I use the same open source standards-based libraries and the same main application code. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Minor Vendor Differences**</span> | I minimize the impact of any vendor-specific code required by either AWS Cognito or Microsoft Entra ID. |

### Components

The components remain those that I used with this blog's default authorization server.

### SPAs in 2021

<span style={{color:'red'}}>This sample uses the traditional SPA solution, with OpenID Connect implemented solely in JavaScript. In 2021 the best practice is to upgrade to a <Link href='/posts/spa-back-end-for-front-end'>Backend for Frontend</Link> approach.</span>

The traditional SPA flow remains useful to represent a pure SPA architecture and to learn about Entra ID integration. This blog’s <Link href='/posts/final-spa-overview'>Final SPA</Link> provides a BFF based solution, but requires a more complex flow.

### Code Download

Clone the project with the below command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample.azure
```

![repo](/images/190/repo.jpg)

### Local Computer Hosting

In this post I explain some setup details for the Entra ID authorization server. The following components run at these URLs in the end-to-end flow:

| Component | URL |
| --------- | --- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Secured API**</span> | *https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Secured SPA**</span> | *https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa* |

To get a working system you would need to follow the steps in this post for your own Microsoft account and then reconfigure the apps. The configuration is a little complex though, due to my requirement to issue custom claims to access tokens.

### Step 1. Azure Sign Up

I used the [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/) offer and signed up for a developer account:

![azure trial](/images/190/azure-trial.jpg)

### Step 2. Log in to the Entra ID Portal

After email confirmation I visited [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com) and could manage a directory whose domain name is based on by registration email:

![azure directory](/images/190/azure-directory.jpg)

Note the *Tenant ID*, since the *Authorization Server Base URL* has the following form:

- *https://login.microsoftonline.com/[tenantid]/v2.0*

The *OpenID Connect Discovery Endpoint* for my developer account is therefore at the following location:

- [https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration)

### Step 3. Configure Test User Accounts

Next I navigated to *Users* and created the two users for testing to match those in the previous code sample:

![test accounts](/images/190/test-accounts.jpg)

I created the *Guest User* and *Guest Admin* accounts with the following login names based on my domain:

- *guestuser@[mytenant].onmicrosoft.com*
- *guestadmin`@`[mytenant].onmicrosoft.com*

I assigned each user *First name* and *Last name* fields. The *Object ID* field is the unique account identifier of each user account:

![built in user attributes](/images/190/built-in-user-attributes.jpg)

I then did an initial login for each user with the following steps in a new incognito browser window, to configure the user for MFA, as Entra ID requires. I used the Google authenticator app on my mobile device.

- In the Entra ID Portal, reset the user’s password to get a temporary one.
- Login to the SPA and reset the password when prompted.
- There follows a prompt to create an entry in an authenticator app.
- The browser login form then presents a QR code.
- On my mobile device I scanned the QR code in my authenticator app.
- In the browser I then entered the authenticator app’s one-time-code.

On all subsequent logins I only enter the username and password, until I am again prompted for a new one-time-code from the authenticator app.

### Step 4. Register an OAuth Client for the API

By default, APIs are not OAuth clients. Microsoft have some rules around data protection that relate to the [RFC 8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707) proposed standard, which requires an API registration. I added a client called BasicAPI, without selecting a platform. I use this client to represent a logical collection of one or more related APIs. Access tokens issued later will use the below *Client ID* in their *audience* claim:

![api client](/images/190/api-client.jpg)

I then switched to the *Owners* tab and added my personal Microsoft user account as the owner of the application registration:

![api owner](/images/190/api-owner.jpg)

The API client registration define scopes. I navigated to *Expose an API* and created a custom scope called *investments*:

![api custom scope](/images/190/api-custom-scope.jpg)

The API acts as a client to the Microsoft Graph endpoint, to get userinfo. Under *API Permissions*, I selected *Add a permission / Microsoft Graph / Delegated permissions* and added the *openid* and *profile* built-in OpenID Connect scopes. I also selected the *Grant Admin Consent for Default Directory* option:

![api permissions](/images/190/api-permissions.jpg)

Next, I created a client secret which the API will use when it connects to Microsoft Graph:

![api client secret](/images/190/api-client-secret.jpg)

Finally, I edited the manifest data to use the latest access token version:

![api manifest](/images/190/api-manifest.jpg)

### Step 5. Register an OAuth Client for the SPA

Under *Applications / App Registrations*, I selected *New Registration* and added a client called BasicSPA, selecting the *Single Page Application* platform type.

![spa client](/images/190/spa-client.jpg?v=20240816)

I made my personal account the owner of this application registration and again updated to the latest access token format. Next, I navigated to API Permissions, selected *Add a permission / My APIs* and chose the investments scope. Again I selected the *Grant Admin Consent for Default Directory* option:

![spa permissions](/images/190/spa-permissions.jpg)

### Step 6. Populate Custom User Attributes

Next I defined two custom attributes to store against user accounts in the identity data, to match the setup from the <Link href='/posts/user-data'>User Data</Link> post. Once populated against user accounts, these attributes are included in access tokens issued to the SPA client:

| User Attribute | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**manager_id**</span> | A business user identity that the API receives in access tokens. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**role**</span> | A user role that the API uses in its authorization logic. |

I navigated to the *Cross-Tenant Synchronization* screen and added these fields to the user accounts schema:

![custom user attributes](/images/190/custom-user-attributes.jpg)

Populating these values for my two test user accounts was a little cryptic. First I created a new client called *UserAdmin* without setting a platform. I then generated a client secret. Again I made my Microsoft account the owner and updated to the access token version 2 format. In total I created the following registrations:

![app registrations](/images/190/app-registrations.jpg)

Entra ID automatically creates the extensions app ands store custom user attributes there. The *UserAdmin* app administers all user accounts using the client credentials flow. Therefore I granted it *User.ReadWriteAll* application permissions (not delegated permissions). To populate the values for my two test user accounts I had to write some client code to call the Graph API. I did this as a bash script that uses the [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) tool. The code sample repository contains the script:

- [utils/populate_custom_user_attributes.sh](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample.azure/blob/master/utils/populate-custom-user-attributes.sh)

My two custom user attributes are extension attributes with the following full technical names. The middle part is the *client_id* of the extensions app registration with hyphens removed:

- extension_32ee1b779fea4ee2be2dcaf30f23d83a_manager_id
- extension_32ee1b779fea4ee2be2dcaf30f23d83a_role

### Step 7. Issue Custom Access Token Claims

To customize access tokens you edit the API client registration, starting by selecting the following link. My code sample avoids customizing ID tokens, but to do so you would follow an equivalent process for the SPA client registration:

![edit api client](/images/190/edit-api-client.jpg)

This makes a *Single Sign On* tab available from which you can select *Attributes & Claims*. Here I added the custom claims using a source location of *Directory Schema Extension*. I used a *custom_* prefix to avoid conflicts with the built-in *role* claim:

![directory schema extensions](/images/190/directory-schema-extensions.jpg)

Next you need to return to the API manifest and make a change to set *accessTokenMappedClaims=true*. This avoids cryptic warnings about the API needing its own signing key.

### Step 8. Download the Code Sample

You can then download the code, then open it in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample.azure
```

Identify the configuration files containing OAuth settings used by the UI and API:

<div className="smallimage">
![code layout](/images/190/code-layout.jpg)
</div>

### Step 9. Update SPA Configuration

For the SPA update both the *Tenant ID* and the SPA’s *Client ID* to your own value:

```json
{
    "app": {
        "apiBaseUrl":             "https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api"
    },
    "oauth": {
        "authority":              "https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/v2.0",
        "clientId":               "e9a29a01-21b4-4533-bae6-438141ebc05c",
        "redirectUri":            "https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/",
        "postLogoutRedirectUri":  "https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/loggedout.html",
        "scope":                  "openid api://552b475c-471d-43a1-9dfe-f6b895931110/investments"
    }
}
```

### Step 10. Update API Configuration

For the API configuration, replace the *Tenant ID* with your own value, and also update the *Audience* and *Client ID* values with those for the API:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "port": 443,
        "sslCertificateFileName": "./certs/authsamples-dev.ssl.p12",
        "sslCertificatePassword": "Password1",
        "trustedOrigins": [
            "https://www.authsamples-dev.com"
        ],
        "useProxy": false,
        "proxyUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
    },
    "oauth": {
        "jwksEndpoint":                  "https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/discovery/v2.0/keys",
        "tokenEndpoint":                 "https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/oauth2/v2.0/token",
        "userInfoEndpoint":              "https://graph.microsoft.com/oidc/userinfo",
        "issuer":                        "https://login.microsoftonline.com/7f071fbc-8bf2-4e61-bb48-dabd8e2f5b5a/v2.0",
        "audience":                      "552b475c-471d-43a1-9dfe-f6b895931110",
        "scope":                         "investments",
        "claimsCacheTimeToLiveMinutes":  15,
        "graphClient": {
            "clientId":                  "552b475c-471d-43a1-9dfe-f6b895931110",
            "clientSecret":              "VFu8Q~i~l3Ysiji~jvBgmDphm_IhDLuuOTapkaCe",
            "scope":                     "openid profile"
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration is equivalent to that of the earlier <Link href='/posts/improved-spa-code-sample-overview'>Updated SPA and API</Link>, which ran against AWS Cognito. The Graph details in the configuration are explained in the next post.

### Step 11. Configure DNS

Update the hosts file on your computer to include this blog’s local development domains, described in the earlier <Link href='/posts/oauth-infrastructure-setup'>OAuth Infrastructure Setup</Link> post:

```markdown
127.0.0.1 www.authsamples-dev.com api.authsamples-dev.com
```

### Step 12. Build the Code

Next run the following script, which downloads some  OpenSSL generated certificates, then build the SPA and API code:

```bash
./build.sh
```

### Step 13. Configure SSL Trust

The API and web static content hosting uses SSL so you must ensure that your browser trusts the root certificate at the below location, as explained in the <Link href='/posts/developer-ssl-setup'>Developer SSL Setup</Link> post.

```markdown
api/certs/authsamples-dev.ca.crt
```

### Step 14. Run the SPA

Next run the following script, to run the API over SSL on port 443. The default browser then runs at *https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa*. The SPA redirects to Microsoft online and you can sign in with one of the test user accounts:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Login completes successfully and you can run the same SPA and API that was previously run against AWS Cognito. There are some minor OAuth differences but both apps use essentially the same code.

### Where Are We?
