# How to Run the React SPA

Previously we provided a <Link href='/posts/final-spa-overview'>Final SPA Overview</Link> and next we will show how to run the final SPA on a development computer in a couple of different configurations.

### Prerequisites

The scripts in this post are meant to be run from a Linux or macOS terminal, or a Git Bash shell on Windows. You also need to have an up to date version of Node.js installed.

### Step 1: Download the GitHub Code

The SPA project is available here, and can be downloaded / cloned to your local computer with this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample.final
```

### Step 2: Add Domains to your Computer

You will need to ensure that this blog’s web development domain points to your local computer, by making a local DNS entry in your hosts file, which will exist at one of these locations:

| OS | Path |
| -- | ---- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Windows**</span> | c:\system32\drivers\etc\hosts |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**macOS / Linux**</span> | /etc/hosts |

Add entries as follows to represent the domain that serves the SPA’s static web content:

```markdown
127.0.0.1  localhost www.authsamples-dev.com
```

### Step 3: View Components in an IDE

The web code consists of the following main areas:

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**spa**</span> | The code for the SPA, which calls cross domain APIs using secure cookies |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**webhost**</span> | A web host for local computer setups, to serve web static content to the browser |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**deployment**</span> | Resources used for managing and automating various deployment scenarios |

<div className="smallimage">
![code layout](/images/230/code-layout.jpg)
</div>

### Step 4: View the React Code

The SPA has been updated to use React, though view classes have the same behaviour as those from <Link href='/posts/basicspa-codingkeypoints'>Earlier SPA Code Samples</Link>:

```typescript
export function TitleView(props: TitleViewProps): JSX.Element {

    return  (
        <div className='row'>
            <div className='col-8 my-auto'>
                <HeadingView />
            </div>
            {props.userInfo &&
                <div className='col-4 my-auto'>
                    <UserInfoView {...props.userInfo}/>
                </div>
            }
        </div>
    );
}
```

React provides a modern toolset that will helps to enable productivity and capabilities for web development:

| Benefit | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Markup**</span> | A strongly typed and secure way to work with markup and the DOM, including handling of dangerous input |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Components**</span> | A componentized development model, that promotes clean code and a separation of concerns |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Ecosystem**</span> | We can follow web development best practice techniques from the community |

### Step 5: Build the Code

Open a terminal and run the following command. The script builds the SPA into JavaScript bundles and prepares a basic web host to serve them as static content:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This runs the frontend in watch mode, so that it can be developed with a pure SPA development model. The React code can be updated and changes quickly reflected in the browser:

![spa build](/images/230/spa-build.jpg)

### Step 6: Configure SSL Trust

The web host uses SSL and downloads some development certificates, so you must ensure that your browser trusts the root certificate at the below location, as explained in the <Link href='/posts/developer-ssl-setup'>Developer SSL Setup</Link> post.

```markdown
certs/authsamples-dev.ca.crt
```

### Step 7: Run the App

Next start a second terminal window and run the following command, which will start the web host, then invoke the default browser at *https://www.authsamples-dev.com*:

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Step 8: Login to the SPA

You will then be prompted to sign in, and can do so with this test credential:

- User: *guestuser@example.com*
- Password: *GuestPassword1*

After login the SPA sends an HttpOnly encrypted cookie containing an AWS Cognito access token to the AWS API gateway. The cookie is decrypted and the access token is forwarded to lambda-based APIs which validate the access token and use claims-based authorization. When the frontend is authorized it receives and renders data returned from the API:

![spa data](/images/230/spa-data.jpg?v=20240713)

### Step 9: View Secure Cookies

The SPA no longer uses tokens in the browser. Instead, API requests send a short-lived access token encrypted into an *HttpOnly SameSite=strict Secure* cookie. Since Cognito uses RS256 JWTs, the cookie size is around 1.5KB, which is comfortably below browser limits.

You can use browser tools to view secure cookies, which are for the backend for frontend subdomain and not the web origin. The SPA does not require any cookies to download static content, and does not use cookies when the user performs navigation operations:

![cookie properties](/images/230/cookie-properties.jpg?v=20240817)

### Step 10: View Updated SPA Configuration

In earlier samples, the SPA performed its own OpenID Connect work in JavaScript. This work is now done by remote token handler components, and the SPA code and configuration is therefore reduced to a backend for frontend base URL:

```json
{
    "bffBaseUrl": "https://bff.authsamples-dev.com"
}
```

### Step 11: Understand Web Security Headers

The web host now writes a number of security headers, the most interesting of which is the *Content Security Policy*. This has the following values, since the SPA now only makes remote calls via its backend for frontend:

```markdown
content-security-policy:
  default-src 'none';
  script-src 'self';
  connect-src 'self' https://bff.authsamples-dev.com;
  child-src 'self';
  img-src 'self';
  style-src 'self';
  object-src 'none'
  frame-ancestors 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  form-action 'self'
strict-transport-security: max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload
x-frame-options: DENY
x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block 
x-content-type-options: nosniff
referrer-policy: same-origin
```

### Local API Setup

It is also possible to run an API that provides the SPA’s data on the local computer, but you then need to manage cookies for this routing. One way to do so is to run a local token handler. To do so, first ensure that a docker engine is installed, and also the envsubst tool.

### Step A: Run the API

Select one of this blog’s final APIs from the below list, and follow its instructions, to run the API on port 446:

- <Link href='/posts/api-architecture-node'>Node.js API</Link>
- <Link href='/posts/net-core-code-sample-overview'>.NET API</Link>
- <Link href='/posts/java-spring-boot-api-overview'>Java Spring Boot API</Link>

### Step B: Update DNS

Next, add the API subdomain and local backend for frontend domain to your computer’s hosts file:

```markdown
127.0.0.1  localhost www.authsamples-dev.com api.authsamples-dev.com bfflocal.authsamples-dev.com
```

### Step C: Run the SPA against a Local API

To make the SPA connect to one of this blog’s final APIs, first ensure that the API is running. Then use a *LOCALAPI* parameter when running the scripts described earlier:

```bash
./build.sh LOCALAPI
./run.sh LOCALAPI
```

This will run the utility token handler components in a small docker compose network. The SPA’s configuration will then be updated as follows, to route to the API via the local backend for frontend rather than the cloud one:

```json
{
    "bffBaseUrl": "https://bfflocal.authsamples-dev.com:444"
}
```

### Step D: Use the SPA and API

When you now use the SPA it will call the local API rather than a cloud API. The API behaviour includes logging output that is explained in later blog posts, under the API theme.

### Step E: Understand Token Handler Deployment

To understand how I deploy the OAuth agent and OAuth proxy components, you can study my [deployment resources](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth-agent-node-express/blob/master/deployment/docker-local/docker-compose.yml). I use the Kong API Gateway to expose a backend for frontend with the following configuration settings, expressed as environment variables:

```bash
PORT=8000
TRUSTED_WEB_ORIGIN='https://www.authsamples-dev.com'
ISSUER='https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9'
AUTHORIZE_ENDPOINT='https://login.authsamples.com/oauth2/authorize'
TOKEN_ENDPOINT='https://login.authsamples.com/oauth2/token'
USERINFO_ENDPOINT='https://login.authsamples.com/oauth2/userInfo'
LOGOUT_ENDPOINT='https://login.authsamples.com/logout'
CLIENT_ID='7q5pope8rki7okarj2u8l4in7o'
CLIENT_SECRET='1d18g4v05sesjkv161borl012j009l7ooktnfs10ph9p6nkbbfl9'
REDIRECT_URI='https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/'
POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI='https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/loggedout'
SCOPE='openid profile https://api.authsamples.com/investments'
COOKIE_NAME_PREFIX='authsamples'
COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY='33be02f1b76feccf2c30a4847b0ad68d01756d7a9fb7f9a533b12b5d249a9c66'
SERVER_CERT_P12_PATH='./certs/authsamples-dev.ssl.p12'
SERVER_CERT_P12_PASSWORD='Password1'
```

When using the token handler pattern you remotely deploy these components. You do not need to develop them. The frontend development setup is therefore focused solely on the user interface, in the same way as this blog’s earlier SPAs.

### Step F: Free Docker Resources

To free resources in the docker compose network, run the following command:

```bash
./teardown.sh LOCALAPI
```

### Where Are We?

We have explained how to run the final web sample, which has more moving parts than earlier code samples. The React demo SPA can be run as a single component under development. The app is in control of its own OpenID Connect flow. After user logins, the SPA calls deployed API components using secure cookies.
