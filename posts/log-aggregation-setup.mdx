# Elasticsearch Log Aggregation Setup

Previously we ran some <Link href='/posts/api-automated-tests'>API Automated Tests</Link>, and next we will deploy a local Docker-based log aggregation system. This enables logs to flow from APIs during development.

### API Logging Output

At this point we have completed our API coding and the log data contains useful fields that are written to text files, one line per entry:

```json
{"id":"f1c38406-6d1e-212f-ee8b-e100a4219b28","utcTime":"2022-07-15T17:34:28.631Z","apiName":"FinalApi","operationName":"getCompanyList","hostName":"MACSTATION.local","method":"GET","path":"/investments/companies","statusCode":401,"errorCode":"unauthorized","millisecondsTaken":10,"millisecondsThreshold":500,"correlationId":"b868385c-e8fa-9496-9d5b-492158e3d555","errorData":{"statusCode":401,"clientError":{"code":"unauthorized","message":"Missing, invalid or expired access token"},"context":"No access token was supplied in the bearer header"}}
{"id":"c997e4f0-e7a3-ed9c-253f-fd25110a4a33","utcTime":"2022-07-15T17:34:37.065Z","apiName":"FinalApi","operationName":"getCompanyTransactions","hostName":"MACSTATION.local","method":"GET","path":"/investments/companies/2/transactions","resourceId":"2","clientApplicationName":"LoadTest","userId":"a6b404b1-98af-41a2-8e7f-e4061dc0bf86","statusCode":200,"millisecondsTaken":124,"millisecondsThreshold":500,"correlationId":"bd845c50-8995-92eb-fb2f-bc81a4405fef","sessionId":"50f7bbae-04a2-8ba1-1cde-6a44916ab4aa"}
{"id":"8e41a54c-1d40-8269-c8f4-12b1bf54ad74","utcTime":"2022-07-15T17:34:37.046Z","apiName":"FinalApi","operationName":"getUserInfo","hostName":"MACSTATION.local","method":"GET","path":"/investments/userinfo","clientApplicationName":"LoadTest","userId":"a6b404b1-98af-41a2-8e7f-e4061dc0bf86","statusCode":200,"millisecondsTaken":162,"millisecondsThreshold":500,"correlationId":"5ec0eedf-0dcf-aa8d-f64c-1522e8a65a32","sessionId":"50f7bbae-04a2-8ba1-1cde-6a44916ab4aa"}
```

Of course these raw logs are not easy to read, and the next step is to import them into a *Queryable Data Store*. This will not require any coding, but we will need to understand how to configure open source logging tools.

### Logging Technology Stack

We will provide an installation of [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products/elastic-stack) components, which provide a mature platform with some productive features.

![elastic stack](/images/390/elasticstack.jpg)

We will run the following components to a basic level on a development computer, then demonstrate rich and highly useful queries against our API log data.

| Component | Role |
| --------- | ---- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Elasticsearch**</span> | A big data store which provides rich query capabilities |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Kibana**</span> | A UI which we can use for query related operations |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Filebeat**</span> | A lightweight tool to ship JSON log files to Elasticsearch |

Note that our API logging solution is not locked-in to Elastic Stack, and if we ever found a better option we could migrate to it without any API code changes.

### Step 1: Download Elastic Resources

This blog provides some helper resources which can be downloaded with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/logaggregation.elasticsearch
```

We will run scripts from the *docker-local* folder to deploy a development setup for Elasticsearch with working API log aggregation:

<div className="smallimage">
![file layout](/images/390/file-layout.jpg?v=20240818)
</div>

### Step 2: Configure DNS and SSL

First add the following logging domain name to your computer’s hosts file:

```markdown
127.0.0.1 logs.authsamples-dev.com
```

Next run the following script to download a development SSL certificate for this domain name:

```bash
./deployment/docker-local/downloadcerts.sh
```

Then follow instructions to configure <Link href='/posts/developer-ssl-setup'>Browser SSL Trust</Link> for the following root certificate, so that we can run the Kibana UI later:

```markdown
./deployment/docker-local/certs/authsamples-dev.ca.crt
```

### Step 3: Understand Elasticsearch Deployment

Next we will run a Docker Compose deployment, that includes the main Elasticsearch system. The installation uses [xpack security](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-settings.html) to a basic level, with usernames and passwords to secure connections:

```yaml
elasticsearch:
  image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.15.0
  hostname: elasticsearch-internal.authsamples-dev.com
  environment:
    discovery.type: 'single-node'
    xpack.security.enabled: 'true'
    xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: 'false'
    xpack.security.autoconfiguration.enabled: 'false'
    ES_JAVA_OPTS: -Xmx4g
    ELASTIC_PASSWORD: 'Password1'
```

### Step 4: Understand Kibana Deployment

The Kibana system will connect to Elasticsearch as the [kibana_system](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/breaking-changes-7.8.html#builtin-users-changes) user, and the deployment sets an initial password. Meanwhile we will login to the Kibana web UI using admin credentials for a development computer of *elastic / Password1*:

```yaml
kibana:
  image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.15.0
  hostname: kibana-internal.authsamples-dev.com
  ports:
    - 5601:5601
  environment:
    ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS: 'http://elasticsearch-internal.authsamples-dev.com:9200'
    ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME: 'kibana_system'
    ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD: 'Password1'
    SERVER_PUBLICBASEURL: 'https://logs.authsamples-dev.com'
    SERVER_SSL_ENABLED: 'false'
```

Once the installation has completed, Kibana will later be accessible at the following URL. The external HTTPS URL is provided by the Kong API gateway.

- *https://logs.authsamples-dev.com*

### Step 5: Understand Filebeat Deployment

Filebeat is deployed with the following Docker settings, and the log folder for the final API is shared from the host computer to the docker container:

```yaml
filebeat:
  image: docker.elastic.co/beats/filebeat:8.15.0
  command: filebeat -e -strict.perms=false
  hostname: filebeat-internal.authsamples-dev.com
  volumes:
    - ./filebeat.yml:/usr/share/filebeat/filebeat.yml
    - ../../../oauth.apisample.nodejs/logs:/var/log/api
  environment:
    ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME: 'elastic'
    ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD: 'Password1'
```

The main configuration is included in the *filebeat.yml* file, whose JSON settings tell Filebeat to read each bare line of the log file and ship it as an object, while maintaining the data type of each field:

```yaml
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  paths:
  - /var/log/api/*.log
  json:
    keys_under_root: true
    add_error_key: false

output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ['http://elasticsearch-internal.authsamples-dev.com:9200']
  username: elastic
  password: Password1
  index: "apilogs-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: apilogs

setup:
  ilm:
    enabled: false
  template:
    name: apilogs
    pattern: apilogs-*

processors:
- drop_fields:
    fields: ['agent', 'ecs', 'host', 'input', 'version']

```

### Step 6: Generate Logs via an API and Client

To generate local API logs you need to run an API, and a client that calls the API to cause logs to be written. Components should be run in this type of folder layout, at the same level as the log aggregation repository:

```bash
~/dev/logaggregation.elasticsearch
~/dev/oauth.websample.final
~/dev/oauth.apisample.nodejs
```

I sometimes use log aggregation when developing this blog’s secured components, when I want to look more closely at API logs. For example, I can run the final Node.js API locally, with the final SPA as a client.

| Client | Behaviour |
| ------ | --------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**API**</span> | The <Link href='/posts/api-architecture-node'>Final API</Link> post explains how to run a local API setup |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**SPA**</span> | The <Link href='/posts/how-to-run-the-react-js-spa'>Final SPA</Link> post explains how to point to a local API |

To run these components, ensure that you have added the following entries to the hosts file on your local computer. In this configuration, the SPA calls a backend for frontend using cookies, and an access token request is forwarded to the local API:

```markdown
127.0.0.1 logs.authsamples-dev.com api.authsamples-dev.com login.authsamples-dev.com www.authsamples-dev.com bfflocal.authsamples-dev.com
```

With this type of setup you can run the SPA and then make queries against the log aggregation system, to target log entries that your frontend activity generates.

### Step 7: Deploy the Elastic Stack

Run the following command to start the Docker deployment. It may take a few minutes for large Elastic Stack docker containers to download, the first time the deployment is run:

```bash
./deployment/docker-local/deploy.sh
```

A number of actions are then triggered, as indicated by the console output. The init container runs a script to initialize the Elasticsearch database.

```markdown
Deploying the Elastic Stack ...
[+] Running 4/4
⠿ elasticsearch-init-1
⠿ Container elasticstack-apigateway-1     Started
⠿ Container elasticstack-filebeat-1       Started
⠿ Container elasticstack-elasticsearch-1  Started
⠿ Container elasticstack-kibana-1         Started
⠿ Container elasticsearch-init-1          Started
Waiting for the Elastic Stack to become available ...
```

Later, when you are finished with testing, free up all Docker resources with the following command:

```bash
./deployment/docker-local/teardown.sh
```

### Step 8. Access Log Query Tools

Next sign in to Kibana with credentials *elastic / Password1*. There are various tools for working with logs, though I consider the following URL to be the most important:

- *https://logs.authsamples-dev.com/app/dev_tools#/console*

The *Dev Tools* allow you to access API log documents and fields without restriction, unlike many other logging solutions.

![log queries](/images/390/log-queries.jpg?v=20240818)

### Step 9: Understand the API Logs Index

Each log entry will be received as a JSON document within an *apilogs* index. Queries are typically made against top level fields. Meanwhile, JSON objects in logs, such as those used to represent errors, maintain their structure:

```json
{
  "hostName": "MACSTATION.local",
  "apiName": "FinalApi",
  "utcTime": "2022-07-24T14:13:20.647Z",
  "millisecondsTaken": 7,
  "errorCode": "exception_simulation",
  "errorData": {
    "serviceError": {
      "stack": [
        "com.authsamples.api.plumbing.errors.ErrorFactory.createServerError(ErrorFactory.java:20)",
        "com.authsamples.api.plumbing.interceptors.CustomHeaderInterceptor.preHandle(CustomHeaderInterceptor.java:35)",
        "org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerExecutionChain.applyPreHandle(HandlerExecutionChain.java:148)",
        "org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet.doDispatch(DispatcherServlet.java:1062)"],
      "errorCode": "exception_simulation"
    },
    "clientError": {
      "area": "FinalApi",
      "code": "exception_simulation",
      "utcTime": "2022-07-16T08:06:00.268106Z",
      "id": 32802,
      "message": "An exception was simulated in the API"
    },
    "statusCode": 500
  },
  "path": "/investments/companies",
  "correlationId": "fc081b42-2be0-454e-bdf6-f5df444b7b50",
  "id": "14ca7188-a4cb-4df5-9bb7-5f829d97b338",
  "errorId": 32802,
  "clientApplicationName": "LoadTest",
  "method": "GET",
  "operationName": "getCompanyList",
  "sessionId": "9553ffcb-f295-41e5-8b6e-5f9e068c7e2f",
  "userId": "a6b404b1-98af-41a2-8e7f-e4061dc0bf86",
  "@timestamp": "2022-07-16T08:06:00.262Z",
  "millisecondsThreshold": 500,
  "statusCode": 500
}
```

The init container defines a schema for fields received within the *apilogs* index, to ensure that we can dictate data types, rather than Elasticsearch guessing them based on data received:

```json
"index_patterns": ["apilogs*"],
"mappings": 
{
  "properties": 
  {
    "id": 
    {
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    "utcTime": 
    {
      "type": "date"
    },
    "apiName": 
    {
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    "operationName": 
    {
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    "hostName": 
    {
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    "method": 
    {
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    "path": 
    {
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    "resourceId": 
    {
      "type": "keyword"
    }
}
```

The Filebeat configuration ensures that there is a separate index per day. This makes it easy to remove old indexes containing log data after a desired time to live.

### Step 10: Understand Log Ingestion

By default, Filebeat adds some fields to each log entry on the outbound side of processing, and Elasticsearch adds fields during inbound processing. The init container customises the [ingestion pipeline](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html) to ensure that logs contain clean data. 

```json
{
    "description": "Ingestion Pipeline for API Logs",
    "processors": [
      {
        "drop": {
          "if" : "ctx.apiName == null"
        },
        "script": {
          "lang": "painless",
          "description": "Use a client side unique id to prevent duplicates",
          "source": "ctx._id = ctx.id"
        },
        "date" : {
          "field" : "utcTime",
          "formats" : ["ISO8601"]
        },
        "remove": {
          "field": ["log", "stream"],
          "ignore_missing": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

The processors I use for the ingestion pipeline are summarised below:

| Processor | Behaviour |
| --------- | --------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**drop**</span> | Ignores any log events from foreign log files encountered, since our logs all have an *apiName* field.
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**script**</span> | Prevents Elasticsearch from generating a unique *_id* field and instead set it to the id field from API logs. This ensures that if Filebeat gets redeployed and logs reprocessed, there will be no duplicated log entries in the aggregated data.
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**data**</span> | Assigns the *utcTime* from logs to the mandatory *@timestamp* field, rather than using the time logs were received.
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**remove**</span> | This removes any other extra fields that Elasticsearch generates during inbound processing.

### Step 11. Query API Logs

The next post will show a number of  people focused API technical support queries that you can issue, when you have API logs containing useful data. At a software company this would improve productivity.

### Step 12: Troubleshoot Filebeat

It can also be useful to understand how to diagnose logs that do not ship correctly. To do so, first make a remote connection to the Filebeat container with the following commands:

```bash
export FILEBEAT_CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps | grep filebeat | awk '{print $1}')
docker exec -it $FILEBEAT_CONTAINER_ID bash
```

Then view the */var/log* folder, which points to the *api* folder on the host computer, which is mounted as a volume to the docker container:

```markdown
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root       5609 Aug 25 19:43 alternatives.log
drwxr-xr-x 7 filebeat filebeat    224 Oct  7 18:07 api
drwxr-xr-x 1 root     root       4096 Aug 25 19:43 apt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      58592 May 31 15:43 bootstrap.log
-rw-rw---- 1 root     utmp          0 May 31 15:43 btmp
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     184555 Aug 25 19:43 dpkg.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      32032 Aug 25 19:57 faillog
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root     utmp     292292 Aug 25 19:57 lastlog
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root     utmp          0 May 31 15:43 wtmp
```

You should see files whose sizes match those on the host:

```markdown
-rw-r--r-- 1 filebeat filebeat 26311 Oct  2 19:59 api-2022-10-02.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 filebeat filebeat  4657 Oct  3 20:23 api-2022-10-03.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 filebeat filebeat  2103 Oct  7 18:08 api-2022-10-07.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 filebeat filebeat   511 Oct  2 19:46 api.2022-10-02.0.log
```

Alternatively, view Filebeat’s own logs to see details of any log shipping errors:

```bash
export FILEBEAT_CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps | grep filebeat | awk '{print $1}')
docker logs -f $FILEBEAT_CONTAINER_ID
```

The Filebeat documentation explains the component’s [folder layout](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/directory-layout.html), and note that the data folder is used to track offsets in files being shipped:

### Where Are We?

We have deployed the Elastic Stack on a local development computer, and the setup enables local API logs to be aggregated and then queried. In the next post we will drill into queries that work well for people.

### Next

- Next we will run some API <Link href='/posts/api-technical-support-analysis'>Technical Support Analysis</Link> queries
- For a list of all blog posts see the <Link href='/posts/index'>Index Page</Link>
