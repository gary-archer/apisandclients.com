# SSL Trust Configuration

Previously I explained how to use an <Link href='/posts/http-debugging-setup'>HTTP Proxy</Link> to trace OAuth-related requests. Next, I explain how to enable HTTPS connections for development. Future code samples use SSL for all backend connections. I use *SSL* as the colloquial term, to represent [transport level security (TLS) v1.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_1.3).

### Productive OAuth Development

When using OAuth, security components may require you to run an SSL setup on your local computer. Even when this is not the case, I prefer to do so since it is a more real-world setup and closer to production environments.

### SSL for Cloud Environments

Later in this blog I create a <Link href="/posts/cloud-domain-setup">Cloud Domain Setup</Link> for a deployed domain of *authsamples.com*, which runs in AWS. I then use [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) to create AWS issued certificates for these subdomains, that are trusted by clients that call the SSL endpoints.

![managed certificates](/images/110/managed-certificates.jpg?v=20240728)

I use a similar approach for a development computer, for an *authsamples-dev.com* domain. I create a wildcard certificate for the domain and its subdomains. Be aware though that in real deployed environments, your APIs may not directly use HTTPS. Instead, you configure SSL certificates in an *HTTP Reverse Proxy* placed in front of APIs. An API gateway implements this HTTP proxy role.

### Development Certificate Issuance

Some online tutorials create standalone self-signed certificates for *localhost* in a way that does not match real-world certificates. I prefer to instead follow these main steps:

- Create a root certificate authority for development.
- Create SSL server certificates issued by the root CA, with real-world domain names.

Doing so simplifies trust administration, since you only need to deploy root CAs. You also learn about public key infrastructures (PKI). Later, when you deploy your apps to production, certificate trust works in the same way.

### Creating SSL Certificates and Keys

I use the OpenSSL 3 command line tool to create certificates for development. I first create an asymmetric private key and long-lived public certificate for a root authority:

```bash
DOMAIN=example

openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out $DOMAIN.ca.key

openssl req \
    -x509 \
    -new \
    -key $DOMAIN.ca.key \
    -out $DOMAIN.ca.crt \
    -subj "/CN=Example Development CA" \
    -days 3650 \
    -addext 'basicConstraints=critical,CA:TRUE'
```

Next, run commands to create a second asymmetric private key and public certificate. You use the root certificate to issue the SSL server certificate. You can create domains for development by just editing your */etc/hosts* file. To ensure that these are trusted domains when you use them in SSL connections, include them in the *subjectAltName* extension field. 


```bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out $DOMAIN.ssl.key

openssl req \
    -x509 \
    -new \
    -CA $DOMAIN.ca.crt \
    -CAkey $DOMAIN.ca.key \
    -key $DOMAIN.ssl.key \
    -out $DOMAIN.ssl.crt \
    -subj "/CN=*.$DOMAIN.com" \
    -days 365 \
    -addext 'basicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE' \
    -addext 'extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth' \
    -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:$DOMAIN.com,DNS:www.$DOMAIN.com,DNS:api.$DOMAIN.com"

openssl pkcs12 \
    -export \
    -inkey $DOMAIN.ssl.key \
    -in $DOMAIN.ssl.crt \
    -name *.$DOMAIN.com \
    -out $DOMAIN.ssl.p12 \
    -passout pass:Password1
```

In total this results in the following files:

| File | Deployed To |
| ---- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**example.ca.crt**</span> | The root CA, deployed to various trust stores. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**example.ca.key**</span> | The root CA's private key. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**example.ssl.crt**</span> | The SSL certificate. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**example.ssl.key**</span> | The SSL certificate's private key. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**example.ssl.p12**</span> | The protected key and certificate, used by APIs. |

You can use an [Online Certificate Decoder](https://certlogik.com/decoder/) and paste in the *example.ssl.crt* contents to see how recipients view the server's SSL certificate:

![certificate properties](/images/110/wildcard-development-cert.jpg?v=20240728)

### This Blog's SSL Code Samples

To make my code samples easy to run, I store development certificates and keys in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.developmentcertificates) so that code sample scripts can easily download them. You should of course never store real private keys in a source code repository like this. When APIs start, they load the password-protected P12 file, then listen on SSL port 443:

```typescript
public async startListening(): Promise<void> {

    const port = this._configuration.api.port;
    if (this._configuration.api.sslCertificateFileName && this._configuration.api.sslCertificatePassword) {

        const pfxFile = await fs.readFile(this._configuration.api.sslCertificateFileName);
        const sslOptions = {
            pfx: pfxFile,
            passphrase: this._configuration.api.sslCertificatePassword,
        };

        const httpsServer = https.createServer(sslOptions, this._expressApp);
        httpsServer.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`API is listening on HTTPS port ${port}`);
        });

    } else {

        this._expressApp.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`API is listening on HTTP port ${port}`);
        });
    }
}
```

Is is therefore straightforward to upgrade your local connections to SSL. Some tools may also show you the strength of the client to server connection. For example, the Google Chrome browser enables you to view SSL strength from *More Tools / Developer Tools / Security*, where you can verify that the connection uses TLS 1.3.

![local ssl](/images/110/local-ssl.jpg?v=20240728)

By default though, on a development workstation, certificates are not trusted. In the following sections I show how to resolve that both when running applications normally and when using an HTTP proxy tool.

### SSL Trust Configuration

The tricky part of managing SSL trust is to configure it across different tools and technologies, which can include all of these clients:

- Chrome / Safari Browsers
- Edge Browser
- Firefox Browser
- Electron Desktop Apps
- Node.js APIs
- .NET APIs
- Java APIs
- Kotlin Android Apps
- Swift iOS Apps
- Command Line Tools

In this blog I run multiple UI and API code samples, then view OAuth messages for all of them, across these operating systems:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS

### HTTP Proxy Root Certificates

HTTP proxy tools use a man-in-the-middle technique to replace the root of the target URL’s SSL certificate. This enables you to view traffic as HTTP, after which the proxy re-encrypts traffic with its own certificate, then routes the request to its target. The following screenshot shows MITM proxy replacing the root of the development certificates issued earlier.

![mitm cert](/images/110/mitm-cert.jpg?v=20240728)

Some corporate networks use their own SSL proxy / firewall filter that works in a similar manner way, injecting root certificates that replace the root authority of external URLs.

### Trust Bundles

To configure root certificate trust, I start by creating a local trust bundle file at *~/trusted-ca-certs.crt*. This contains root CAs that I need to frequently trust. When running this blog’s code samples, the root authority to trust when tracing HTTPS requests depends whether an HTTP proxy is being used.

| Scenario | Required Trust Configuration |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**HTTP Proxy Running**</span>  | Trust the proxy root certificate. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**HTTP Proxy Not Running**</span> | Trust the development root certificate. |

The bundle file has multiple entries as shown here:

```markdown

When you need to update certificate trust, you can either add trust for the entire bundle or just a particular root CA. The following sections show where trust is added.

### Configure Operating System Trust

On Windows, run the *Microsoft Management Console (MMC.EXE)*, then select the *Certificate Snap In* and import the root certificate(s) under *Local Computer / Trusted Root Certification Authorities*:

![windows trust](/images/110/windows-trust.jpg?v=20240728)

On macOS you instead add the root certificate(s) to the *Keychain Access* application under *System / Certificates*, then enable the *Always Trust* option:

![macos trust](/images/110/macos-trust.jpg?v=20240728)

To trust a root CA on Ubuntu Linux I copy a file with a *.crt* extension to the system's *ca-certificates* folder, then run the command to update trusted certificate authorities:

```bash
sudo cp ~/trusted-ca-certs.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

You may need to split the root certificates into individual files. To manage updates and deletes, use the *-f* option of the *update-ca-certificates* command, to remove entries for certificate files that no longer exist in the *ca-certificates* folder.

### Trust a Root Certificate in Browsers

Browsers mostly inherit SSL trust from their operating system default trust stores. You therefore enable certificate trust as I explain above, though there are some browser exceptions. On Firefox, you must navigate to *Options / Privacy & Security / Certificates / View Certificates / Authorities / Import* to import a root certificate. You must also do so if you run Google Chrome on Linux. When you add trust, select the option to *Trust this CA to identify websites*.

![firefox trust](/images/110/firefox-trust.jpg?v=20240728)

### Trusting a Root Certificate in Node.js APIs

In the previous HTTP proxy post I used a hack to set an environment variable, so that Node.js trusts any certificate issuer:

```bash
export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```

A more correct option is to allow particular root CAs using the following environment variable, which I set permanently on my computer:

```bash
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=~/trusted-ca-certs.crt
```

### Trusting a Root Certificate in .NET APIs

This blog's <Link href='/posts/net-core-code-sample-overview/'>OAuth Secured .NET API</Link> uses certificate trust inherited from the operating system SSL trust store.

### Trusting a Root Certificate in Java APIs

This blog's <Link href='/posts/java-spring-boot-api-overview'>OAuth Secured Java API</Link> uses certificate trust from the Java trust store. For example, on Ubuntu Linux this is at the following location when running Java 21:

```markdown
/usr/lib/jvm/zulu-21-amd64/lib/security/cacerts
```

Operations to manage certificates use the [keytool utility](https://www.techquintal.com/java-keytool-keystore-commands), and I use the following commands to add, find and remove a trusted root:

```bash
sudo "$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool" -import -alias mitmroot -cacerts -file ~/trusted-ca-certs.crt -storepass changeit -noprompt
sudo "$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool" -list -alias mitmroot -cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt
sudo "$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool" -delete -alias mitmroot -cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt
```

### Trusting a Root Certificate in Electron Apps

For this blog's <Link href='/posts/desktop-apps-overview'>OAuth Secured Desktop Apps</Link> there are two processes, which determine certificate trust with different rules:

| Area | Trust Behaviour |
| ---- | --------------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Main Process**</span> | For requests from the main side of the app, [NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS may not enable certificate trust](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10257). During development you may have to use the environment variable *NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0*. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Renderer Process**</span> | The Chromium browser uses the same trust store as the Google Chrome browser. |

### Trusting a Root Certificate in Command Line Tools

Command line tools usually use the default operating system trust store, so that these commands work once the tools trust root certificates:

```bash
curl https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api/companies
openssl s_client -connect api.authsamples-dev.com:443
```

When required, you can use a different certificate bundle file via an override. The OpenSSL output can provide detailed output on any trust errors.

```bash
curl --cacert ~/trusted-ca-certs.crt https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api/companies
openssl s_client -CAfile ~/trusted-ca-certs.crt -connect api.authsamples-dev.com:443
```

### Trusting a Root Certificate in iOS and Android

Mobile SSL trust has its own complexities, which are covered in the later posts on mobile setup:

- <Link href='/posts/android-https-debugging'>Android HTTPS Debugging</Link>
- <Link href='/posts/ios-https-debugging'>iOS HTTPS Debugging</Link>

### Where Are We?

I explained how to upgrade the development setup so that you can use real-world SSL URLs for development. When doing so you should also learn how to configure trust so that you can view any OAuth-related requests sent over HTTPS URLs.
