# Updated SPA and API – Overview

Previously I summarised the use of <Link href='/posts/id-tokens'>ID Tokens</Link> in applications. Next I explain how to complete the initial SPA and API code sample, to add the main frontend session behaviors and to add claims-based authorization to the API.

### New Features

The updated SPA and API code sample has the following additional features:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Claims Based Authorization**</span> | The API provides a more complete and future-proof claims-based authorization solution. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**In-Memory Token Storage**</span> | The SPA now stores OAuth tokens only in-memory, to improve the browser security a little. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Silent Token Renewal**</span> | The SPA now supports silent access token renewal using the SSO cookie. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Multi Tab Browsing**</span> | The token renewal solution enables multi tab-browsing without noticeable user impact. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Logout**</span> | The SPA implements a basic form of logout, including logout across multiple browser tabs. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Developer SSL URLs**</span> | Both the SPA and API run on a development computer using real-world HTTPS URLs. |

### Updated Components

I show the updated components and endpoints below, which include the use of an API memory cache to store authorization values used across multiple requests:

### SPAs in 2021

<span style={{color:'red'}}>This sample uses the traditional SPA solution, with OpenID Connect implemented solely in JavaScript. In 2021 the best practice is to upgrade to a <Link href='/posts/spa-back-end-for-front-end'>Backend for Frontend</Link> approach.</span>

The traditional SPA flow remains useful for representing a pure SPA architecture and learning about OAuth techniques. This blog’s <Link href='/posts/final-spa-overview'>Final SPA</Link> provides a BFF based solution, but requires a more complex flow.

### Code Download

Clone the project with the below command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.websample2
```

![repo](/images/170/repo.jpg)

### Code Layout

The SPA uses the same components as the initial code sample, with SPA code that runs in the browser and an API backend.

<div className="smallimage">
![code layout](/images/170/code-layout.jpg)
</div>

### View Updated Configuration

The SPA now uses more complete OAuth settings and HTTPS URLs:

```json
{
    "app": {
        "apiBaseUrl":             "https://api.authsamples-dev.com/api"
    },
    "oauth": {
        "provider":               "cognito",
        "authority":              "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9",
        "clientId":               "hje94a2jj3lgkobkh57ikenhh",
        "redirectUri":            "https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa",
        "postLogoutRedirectUri":  "https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/loggedout.html",
        "scope":                  "openid profile email https://api.authsamples.com/api/investments",
        "customLogoutEndpoint":   "https://login.authsamples.com/logout"
    }
}
```

The API configuration is similarly updated:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "port": 443,
        "sslCertificateFileName": "./certs/authsamples-dev.ssl.p12",
        "sslCertificatePassword": "Password1",
        "trustedOrigins": [
            "https://www.authsamples-dev.com"
        ],
        "useProxy": false,
        "proxyUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
    },
    "oauth": {
        "jwksEndpoint":                  "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9/.well-known/jwks.json",
        "userInfoEndpoint":              "https://login.authsamples.com/oauth2/userInfo",
        "issuer":                        "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-2_CuhLeqiE9",
        "audience":                      "",
        "claimsCacheTimeToLiveMinutes":  15
    }
}
```

### Updated OAuth Client

The SPA now requires an updated client registration. In AWS Cognito, this blog's default authorization server, there are new settings for *Custom Scope* and *Post Logout Redirect URI*:

![spa client](/images/170/spa-client.jpg)

### Build the Code

First run the build script to prepare the SPA and API, which primarily runs *npm install* to download dependencies:

```bash
./build.sh
```

### Configure SSL Browser Trust

The build script also downloads OpenSSL generated certificates from a [Development Certificates](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.developmentcertificates) repository to a subdirectory of the API. The API and web static content hosting uses SSL so you must ensure that your browser trusts the root certificate at the below location, as explained in the <Link href='/posts/developer-ssl-setup#trust-a-root-certificate-in-browsers'>Developer SSL Setup</Link> post.

```markdown
api/certs/authsamples-dev.ca.crt
```

### Run the SPA and API

Next execute the following script to run SPA and API in separate terminal windows. This primarily just runs *npm start* to run both the SPA and API in watch mode:

```bash
./run.sh
```

The SPA terminal window builds JavaScript bundles:

![spa build](/images/170/spa-build.jpg?v=20240831)

The API terminal window listens for requests from the SPA on port 443:

![api build](/images/170/api-build.jpg?v=20240831)

### Test Logins with Multiple User Accounts

Continue to use the following AWS Cognito test account to sign in to the SPA:

- User = *guestuser@example.com*
- Password = *GuestPassword1*

You can also use a second test account with higher privileges, to see additional API data in the SPA:

- User = *guestadmin`@`example.com*
- Password = *GuestPassword1*

The updated SPA shows different data depending on the user since the API now applies claims-based authorization.

### Updated Access Token

After a login the SPA receives the following access token. This now contains an *investments* scope and custom claims for *manager_id* and *role*. The API uses these values for its authorization:

![token scopes and claims](/images/170/token-scopes-and-claims.jpg)

For details on how the authorization server issues these scopes and claims see the <Link href='/posts/managed-authorization-server-setup'>Cloud Authorization Server Setup</Link> blog post.

### API Claims Based Authorization

The API’s OAuth processing reads the token claims and also looks up extra values that it needs to implement its authorization. I provide further details on my design choices in the <Link href='/posts/api-authorization-design'>API Authorization Behaviour</Link> blog post.

![extensible claims](/images/170/extensible-claims.jpg)

The API serves hard coded JSON data, representing multiple regions:

```json
[
    {
        "id":               1,
        "name":             "Company 1",
        "region":           "Europe",
        "targetUsd":        20000000,
        "investmentUsd":    13801299,
        "noInvestors":      2310
    },
    {
        "id":               2,
        "name":             "Company 2",
        "region":           "USA",
        "targetUsd":        35000000,
        "investmentUsd":    41251365,
        "noInvestors":      3951
    }
]
```

Each user has access to data from an array of regions, and the default guest user only has access to the US region, so I cannot see items 1 and 3. Therefore the API filters those values from the results it returns to the SPA:

![filtered list](/images/170/filtered-list.jpg?v=20240813)

In the transactions view, if the user tries to access company 3 data by editing the browser URL, the SPA triggers an API request for an unauthorized resource. The API denies access and returns a 404 response with a *company_not_found* error code.

![authorized resource](/images/170/authorized-resource.jpg?v=20240813)

The SPA handles this *Not Found For User* API error code specially and redirects to the home page, to avoid displaying a user error.

### SPA Downloads User Info

As for the first code example, the SPA continues to get name details for display from the OpenID Connect userinfo endpoint:

```json
{
    "sub": "06e3c525-33d1-47ec-97be-03d8affc3726",
    "custom:manager_id": "10345",
    "email_verified": "true",
    "given_name": "Guest",
    "family_name": "User",
    "custom:role": "user",
    "email": "guestuser@example.com",
    "username": "06e3c525-33d1-47ec-97be-03d8affc3726"
}
```

The SPA also calls a user info endpoint in its own API to get secondary user attributes, which are not stored in the identity data:

```json
{
    "title":"Regional Manager",
    "regions":["USA"]
}
```

The secondary user data is then rendered in a basic tooltip:

![secondary user data](/images/170/secondary-user-data.jpg?v=20240813)

### Triggering Token Renewal

The SPA now refreshes in-memory access tokens silently when they expire. You can simulated this if you click *Expire Token* then *Reload Data*:

![token expiry testing](/images/170/token-expiry-testing.jpg?v=20240813)

Since the SPA stores tokens in-memory, the same renewal occurs if you refresh the browser page or the user performs multi-tab browsing using one of the *View Transactions* links to open a new browser window. The following actions should then take place:

- The SPA receives a 401 response from the API.
- The SPA triggers a silent iframe token renewal redirect using the SSO cookie.
- The SPA receives a new access token without any user impact.
- The SPA retries the API call with the new access token.

### Token Renewal OAuth Requests

The updated code sample implements the traditional SPA token renewal flow, where the SPA attempts to gsend the SSO cookie to get a new access token, using the *prompt=none* query parameter:

![iframe renewal request](/images/170/iframe-renewal-request.jpg?v=20240813)

Yet AWS Cognito is not compliant with the iframe renewal flow, so when it is the authorization server, the SPA falls back to using a refresh token to renew access tokens:

![renewal request](/images/170/renewal-request.jpg?v=20240813)

The response includes a new access token, so that the SPA can continue to call APIs without impacting the user:

![renewal response](/images/170/renewal-response.jpg?v=20240813)

Although the SPA's code implements renewal flows correctly, both of them are unsatisfactory. I explain the security and usability issues in the <Link href='/posts/user-sessions-and-token-renewal'>IFrame Access Token Renewal</Link> post.

### Logout

The SPA also implements logout functionality. The SPA removes its own tokens, then redirects to the authorization server sending the SSO cookie. The authorization server expires the SSO cookie to end the user's session, then redirects the browser back to its *Post Logout Redirect URI*, which renders the following view:

![logged out screen](/images/170/logged-out-screen.jpg?v=20240813)

A boolean flag is also stored in session storage after logout. Other tabs use the browser’s storage events to listen for this value being set, then remove tokens from memory and move to the logged out page:

![multi tab logout](/images/170/multi-tab-logout.jpg?v=20240813)

### Where Are We?

I have added missing features to the SPA and API behavior, to improve SPA session management and to enable the API to authorize requests correctly. Overall security and token renewal still have some issues, which I resolve later, in the <Link href='/posts/final-spa-overview'>Final SPA</Link>.
