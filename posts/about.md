I’m a long time [Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-archer-6b3613153/) with an interest in the art of separation. The deeper problems in software usually caused by suboptimal designs. OAuth done right is a great example of solid design choices providing high business value.

### Blog History

I wrote this blog’s main content from 2017-2019, with a focus on non-functional coded requirements during modern API, web and mobile development. I still refine content occasionally, in line with design or technology improvements that enable my requirements to be met in simpler ways.

### Blog Technology

The content is built as a basic Next.js blog and is available in the following GitHub repository. I deploy it as static content to AWS Cloudfront so that it performs well globally. You might use the content as a starting point for your own blog, by replacing the contents of the **/posts** folder.
