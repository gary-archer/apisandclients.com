# API Authorization Behaviour

In <Link href='/posts/user-data'>User Data Management</Link> I explained how any moderately complex real-world system typically stores *core user attributes* separately to *volatile business user attributes*. You also need to deal with both types of data when you authorize requests in your API code.

In this post I suggest how to use access tokens for authorization in APIs. I summarise a few OAuth mechanisms, which you can read more about in many other OAuth resources. This post's main focus is manageability when you implement API authorization.

### Real-World API Authorization

Real-world authorization usually includes a number of fine-grained permissions. A token identifying the user is sent to one or more APIs, which might need to enforce business rules such as these:

- User bob has full access to orders from his own branch.
- User bob has read access to orders from other branches in his area.
- User bob has no access to orders from branches in other areas.

In some cases, end-to-end flows involve multiple APIs. Each API team should be able to manage authorization productively, without depending too much on an identity team. Achieving this outcome requires a solid design for *scopes and claims*.

### API Authorization Steps

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables you to protect business data using access tokens. You can think of it as three main steps:

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Token Validation**</span> | Access token validation, to ensure the integrity of the message credential. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Scope Checks**</span> | Boundary checks to ensure an access token's validity for a particular area of data. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Claims-Based Authorization**</span> | Detailed permission checks against resources, using claims and fine-grained permissions to apply business rules. |

### Step 1: Token Validation

The <Link href='/posts/jwt-access-token-validation'>JWT Access Token Validation</Link> post described how an API verifies the JWT’s digital signature. If the token is not valid you return a 401 error such as the below payload. Think of token validation as an entry level check to authenticate the request to the API. The API then trusts the access token’s payload.

```json
{
  "code": "invalid_token",
  "message": "Missing, invalid or expired access token"
}
```

### Step 2: Scopes

In OAuth you use scopes to restrict API privileges that you grant to clients. You assign one or more scopes to the OAuth client when you register it in the authorization server. Often, a good choice is to do so based on business area, starting with high level values:

| Examples | Usage |
| -------- | ----- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**sales**</span> | You might assign this scope for use at API endpoints that deal with selling products to the public. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**finance**</span> | You might use this scope for API endpoints that deal with a higher security money-based area. |
 
A client with an access token that contains only a *sales* scope can never successfully access data from *finance* API endpoints. The API would immediately reject the access token with a 403 forbidden error. This is true even if the user has finance rights.

### Scopes and Manageability

You cannot use the scopes that you design for dynamic purposes, such as different scopes per user. Aim to keep scopes fairly high level. In this blog I use a fictional *investments* scope and frontend clients need access tokens with this scope to call any endpoint of my example APIs. Creating too many scopes too early can result in productivity problems, like needing to frequently update clients with new scopes, or deal with access token versioning in APIs. Consider only adding new scopes when you extend APIs to new business areas.

You don't usually need many scopes since you use claims for most authorization. Yet you should design scopes in terms of end-to-end flows. If multiple APIs call each other, they should each validate an access token and implement business authorization. When a user is present, each API should receive the user identity and its required scopes and claims in its access token. The source API can send its current access token or use OAuth token exchange to get a new one from the authorization server with different scopes. 

### OpenID Connect Scopes

In addition to business scopes, user facing applications typically use OpenID Connect built-in scopes, which represent areas of the user’s personal data. These tend to be more fine-grained than business scopes.

| Examples | Usage Scenario |
| -------- | -------------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**openid**</span> | Allows an app to use the user’s identity. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**profile**</span> | Allows an app to get a user’s name related information. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**email**</span>	| Allows an app to access a user’s email related information. |

The OpenID Connect scopes show how you can restrict a client's access to fields within an object. Consider using this composition-based approach for your own APIs, when some areas of an object require higher security than others.

### Audience Restrictions

An API should require its own identity to be present in the audience (aud) claim of the access token. This claim can be either a string or an array. You can use audience restrictions in conjunction with scopes to enable or prevent access token sharing. You can set the audience(s) of an access token to match one exact API, multiple exact APIs, or use the same logical name in a set of related APIs.

### Step 3: Claims

Claims enable the deeper OAuth authorization behaviour. For each scope that the authorization server issues to access tokens, it also issues a set of claims. The <Link href='/posts/managed-authorization-server-setup'>Cloud Authorization Server Setup</Link> blog post explains how this works for this blog’s default authorization server. 

You can issue different claims to access tokens per user, and they can contain any data you need, so claims are much more flexible than scopes. In more advanced use cases, APIs cannot decide how to authorize solely from a user ID in an access token. Instead, OAuth enables you to design solutions where the authorization server provides APIs with runtime claims from trusted third-party systems.

### Claims Principal

After your API validates a JWT access token you use its claims in your business authorization code. For example, you can inject a *ClaimsPrincipal* object that contains claims into classes that need it. A well-designed claims principal expresses your API’s main authorization data and should be useful to your API’s code.

```typescript
export class CompanyService {

    private readonly _repository: CompanyRepository;
    private readonly _claims: ClaimsPrincipal;

    public constructor(repository: CompanyRepository, claims: ClaimsPrincipal) {
        this._repository = repository;
        this._claims = claims;
    }
}
```

Of course, you must always make all of the correct authorization checks in your API logic classes, to ensure that no client or user can access unauthorized data. As long as you ensure that there are no security weaknesses, you have some choices on how you manage claims.

### Claims and Manageability

In many real-world systems, claims in access tokens do not provide every data value that you need for authorization. For example, some systems use roles that map to fine-grained permissions representing levels of access, such as the branch rules listed at the start of this post. Sometimes these permissions are volatile and you change or remodel them often.

You should not manage volatile business permissions in your authorization server, since that can lead to the same productivity problems that you get with poorly designed scopes. You usually only need to issue a few custom claims to access tokens. These values should be stable and should not change within a user's authenticated session. When your API authorizes requests it can look up volatile business permissions from other claims in the access token, which is the approach used by this blog's final APIs.

### Customising the Claims Principal

In your API code, you may therefore need to combine access token claims with extra values. You can do this in multiple ways, according to your coding preferences. When I first wrote this blog, the AWS Cognito authorization server did not support issuing custom claims to access tokens, yet I still wanted a useful and expressive claims principal that demonstrated my design intent. I did not want my code to be dictated by the limitations of an authorization server implementation.

Therefore, I designed an object with the following structure, so that I could inject it into business logic classes and the claims that should be in the access token were readily available. In addition, there may be some main authorization values that you may prefer not to issue to access tokens for manageability reasons. These might be good candidates to represent as extra claims.

```json
export class ClaimsPrincipal {
    public jwtClaims: JWTPayload;
    public extraClaims: ExtraClaims;
}
```

My API code samples continue to use this technique, since it is useful to know how to customise OAuth processing in API technology stacks and to be in control of your own objects. The APIs perform JWT validation on every request and then look up extra values from a trusted source - like the API's database - before creating the claims principal. The business logic classes then receive a useful object with which to implement their authorization:

![token to claims](/images/130/token-to-claims.jpg)

Understand that true claims are those that the authorization server asserts when it cryptographically signs access tokens. The main identity values should always be issued to access tokens when possible, so that the API receives them in a cryptographically verifiable format. Yet you might consider the extra values to be claims in practical terms, when they originate from a source that the API trusts just as much as the authorization server. Therefore, extra claims lookup is one option you can consider for a productive API code setup.

### This Blog’s Example Claims

This blog’s APIs use the following form of access token payload. When you design access tokens, imagine you had to explain your API security to a reviewer or a penetration tester. You should be able to point out how the scopes and claims lock down the access token to restrict its privileges.

The scope restricts access to an *investments* business area. The scope and audience would allow the access token to be used by a small set of related APIs. A custom claim for *manager_id* provides a business user identity to the API. A custom *role* claim is issued to the access token, and the API can use it to derive volatile business permissions:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://login.authsamples.com",
  "aud": "api.authsamples.com",
  "scope": "openid profile investments",
  "sub": "a6b404b1-98af-41a2-8e7f-e4061dc0bf86",
  "manager_id": "10345",
  "role": "user",
  "exp": 1714363304.086
}
```

The following extra claims are looked up when the API first receives its access token:

| Extra Claim | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Title**</span> | A business title for the end user in a particular context, which is displayed by the frontend application. |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Regions**</span> | An array claim representing a simplified version of the branches concept described at the start of this post. |

The API authorizes access to resources using both the *role* from the access token and the *regions* array from the extra claims:

```typescript
private _isUserAuthorizedForCompany(company: Company): boolean {

    const role = ClaimsReader.getStringClaim(this._claims.jwt, CustomClaimNames.role).toLowerCase();
    if (role === 'admin') {
        return true;
    }

    if (role !== 'user') {
        return false;
    }

    const extraClaims = this._claims.extra as SampleExtraClaims;
    const found = extraClaims.regions.find((c) => c === company.region);
    return !!found;
}
```

### Claims Caching Algorithm

This blog’s APIs use an OAuth filter with the following overall algorithm, where a thread-safe memory cache stores a hash of the access token mapped to extra claims. This ensures that the extra claims data source lookup only occurs occasionally.

```typescript
export class OAuthFilter {

    public async execute(request: Request): Promise<ClaimsPrincipal> {

        const accessToken = BearerToken.read(request);
        if (!accessToken) {
            throw ErrorFactory.createClient401Error('No access token was supplied in the bearer header');
        }

        const jwtClaims = await this._accessTokenValidator.execute(accessToken);

        const accessTokenHash = createHash('sha256').update(accessToken).digest('hex');
        let extraClaims = await this._cache.getExtraUserClaims(accessTokenHash);
        if (extraClaims) {
            this._extraClaimsProvider.createClaimsPrincipal(jwtClaims, extraClaims, request);
        }

        extraClaims = await this._extraClaimsProvider.lookupExtraClaims(jwtClaims, request);

        await this._cache.setExtraUserClaims(accessTokenHash, extraClaims!, jwtClaims.exp!);

        return this._extraClaimsProvider.createClaimsPrincipal(jwtClaims, extraClaims, request);
    }
}
```

This technique adds complexity to API code, so avoid it when getting started with OAuth. Instead, use claims from the access token payload. Understand though, that some claims-related plumbing code might set up your API's business logic classes in productive ways. The plumbing only needs writing once, after which you can implement many claims checks in your business logic with clean code.

### Where Are We?

I explained some standard OAuth security behaviours and some manageability concerns when you implement API authorization. You should design least-privilege yet stable access tokens and not need to change them often.
