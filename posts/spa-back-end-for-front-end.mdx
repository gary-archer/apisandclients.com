# SPA Backend for Frontend

In the previous post I ran a <Link href='/posts/azure-ad-troubleshooting'>Microsoft Entra ID SPA and API OAuth Flow</Link>. The SPA now needs hardening before it is final, and in a real company we would have two major issues to deal with:

- Concerns about whether using access tokens in the browser is secure enough, and whether HttpOnly cookies should be used instead
- A <Link href='/posts/user-sessions-and-token-renewal'>blocking usability problem</Link> with token renewal and multi tab browsing, due to authorization server cookies being dropped

### Security Best Practices for SPAs

The definitive document on security best practices is [OAuth 2.0 for Browser Based Apps](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps). Due to the threats of malicious JavaScript, there are many token-based threats. The option with the strongest security guarantees is a Backend for Frontend (BFF). SPAs are now encouraged to avoid tokens in the browser and use only the latest and strongest *HttpOnly SameSite=strict Secure* cookies to call APIs. The key benefit of using cookies is to limit the impact of cross-site scripting exploits.

### High Level Requirements

At a higher level, there were three main requirements I wanted to meet for this blog’s final SPA. When first writing this blog I struggled for quite some time to meet all of them.

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Strong Browser Security**</span> | Follow current best practices, with only the latest and most secure cookies used in the browser |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Globally Equal Performance**</span> | Deploy the SPA to a content delivery network, so that web latency is roughly the same everywhere |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Pure SPA Development**</span> | Web developers work productively on frontends, with small code bases and no security plumbing |

### This Blog’s Backend for Frontend

In 2021 I adopted the [Token Handler Pattern](https://github.com/curityio/spa-using-token-handler), which involves using the following API components to deal with the cookie security. These components are stateless and easy to manage, since all state is received in cookies. They are deployed to the API side of the architecture and do not need to run on the computers of web developers, or in the web static content host.

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [OAuth Agent](https://github.com/curityio/oauth-agent-node-express) | An API-driven backend for frontend that simplifies OAuth  work for the SPA and manages a backend client credential. The BFF also issues cookies to the SPA that contain encrypted tokens. |
| [OAuth Proxy](https://github.com/curityio/nginx-lua-oauth-proxy-plugin) | A plugin that runs in a high-performance API gateway. During API requests the plugin decrypts cookies and forwards JWT access tokens to APIs. |

### Security Components

The overall components that need to be deployed are shown here, where the token handler components act as an advanced reverse proxy. Calls from the SPA to APIs must be SameSite so that cookies are classified as first-party, which prevents the browser from dropping them.

The final SPA’s web content is deployed to an [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) web subdomain and does not need securing. The SPA calls an API deployed as Serverless Lambdas to the [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

### API Driven Cookie Issuing

Token handler components run in a dedicated *bff* subdomain that serves as the SPA's entry point to APIs. CORS restricts access to the SPA's precise web origin. Cookies are issued with the following properties. A cookie containing an encrypted short-lived access token becomes the API message credential:

- HTTP-only
- SameSite=strict
- Secure
- Path=/

### Cloud Environment

These are the URLs I designed for the deployed AWS environment. The use of an */spa* path for the SPA indicates that additional micro-frontends for the same business area could be deployed alongside it and share the same cookies. Similarly, additional APIs could be deployed off the API base URL:

| Component | Base URL |
| --------- | -------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**SPA**</span> | *https://www.authsamples.com/spa/* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Investments API**</span> | *https://api.authsamples.com/investments* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Investments API Web Route**</span> | *https://bff.authsamples.com/investments* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**OAuth Agent**</span> | *https://bff.authsamples.com/oauth-agent* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Authorization Server**</span> | *https://login.authsamples.com* |

### Web Development Environment

The final SPA is developed in React, and developers run a *Development Web Host* locally, to serve the SPA's static content.  All other URLs run in the AWS cloud.

| Component | Base URL |
| --------- | -------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**SPA**</span> | *https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Investments API**</span> | *https://api.authsamples.com/investments* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Investments API Web Route**</span> | *https://bff.authsamples-dev.com/investments* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**OAuth Agent**</span> | *https://bff.authsamples-dev.com/oauth-agent* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Authorization Server**</span> | *https://login.authsamples.com* |

The *authsamples-dev.com* site is primarily for components that run on the local computer. Yet the *bff* subdomain is deployed to AWS, to support SPA development. For the web origin and API routes to work together, the web domain must be aliased to localhost in the local computer’s hosts file:

```markdown
127.0.0.1 www.authsamples-dev.com
```

Developers then run the SPA in the browser using its domain name, *https://www.authsamples-dev.com*. There is a pure SPA development setup, where only the React code and a browser needs to be run locally.

### Full Stack Development Environment

It gets more complicated when you need to run both the SPA and APIs locally, which should be avoided most of the time. When required, a local backend for frontend must also be run. I do so in docker containers where an API gateway runs on port 444. The API then runs on port 446 on the host computer:

| Component | Base URL |
| --------- | -------- |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**SPA**</span> | *https://www.authsamples-dev.com/spa/* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Investments API**</span> | *https://api.authsamples-dev.com:446/investments* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Investments API Web Route**</span> | *https://bfflocal.authsamples-dev.com:444/investments* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**OAuth Agent**</span> | *https://bfflocal.authsamples-dev.com:444/oauth-agent* |
| <span style={{color:'green'}}>**Authorization Server**</span> | *https://login.authsamples.com* |

Developers must then also add the *bfflocal* subdomain to the hosts file. An end-to-end local setup can then be run, where the local SPA calls a local API.

### Where Are We?

We have explained the deployment variations for the Final SPA. When using cookies in browser based  apps it can be useful to think through URLs and deployment scenarios early. Doing so can enable the most productive development setups, and also ensure that the web architecture scales effectively.
